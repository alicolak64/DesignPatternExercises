# Factory Design Patterns

### 3 way 

1 -> **Simple Factory** is not design pattern but it is a programming pattern. It is a static method that takes a parameter and returns an object of a class. It is not a design pattern because it does not introduce any new concepts or principles. It is just a programming pattern.

2 -> **Factory Method** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. Uses inheritance for object creation

3 -> **Abstract Factory** is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. Uses composition for object creation

## Principles
1 -> Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes. In short dependency inversion principle.
