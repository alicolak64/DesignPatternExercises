# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Abstract Factory depend on the Factory Method pattern. The difference is that the Factory Method pattern uses inheritance: object creation is delegated to subclasses which implement the factory method to create objects. Abstract Factory uses object composition: object creation is implemented in methods exposed in the factory interface.
