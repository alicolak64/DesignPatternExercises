# Strategy Design Pattern

Strategy Design Pattern is behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Principles 

1 -> Encapsulate what varies

2 -> Program to an interface, not an implementation

3 -> Favor composition over inheritance
